Start EVT
---------
Before starting EVT check if you have a *data* folder inside *app* where to put you XML file(s); otherwise create it. Then check if in the *app/config/config.json* the property *dataUrl* is pointing to your edition file. If you need, you can also change some of the other configuration parameters.
If you need information about the configuration file, please check the *README.md* within the *app* folder, or use the beta EVT2-Config-Generator(http://evt.labcd.unipi.it/evt2-config/) to set your preferences and download a ready to use JSON file.

To start EVT use *grunt*
``` bash
grunt dev
```

Generate EVT Development Documentation
--------------------------------------
``` bash
grunt docs
```
This will create a *devDocs* folder.
Open the *index.html* inside this folder in a browser that allows Cross origin requests (e.g. Firefox) and navigate the documentation.

Troubleshooting
---------------

### IN CASE OF CSS COMPILATION ERRORS
``` bash
sudo gem install rubygems-update
sudo update_rubygems
sudo apt-get install ruby-dev
sudo gem install compass susy
```

### IN CASE OF VISUALIZATION PROBLEMS
```bash
grunt dev --force
```

### EVERY TIME YOU INSTALL A NEW PACKAGE:
Stop *grunt dev* (*CTRL+C*) then:
```bash
bower install
grunt dev
```

### EVERY TIME YOU CHECKOUT TO A DIFFERENT BRANCH:
Stop *grunt dev* (*CTRL+C*) then:
```bash
npm install
bower install
grunt dev
```

Build a new EVT release
-----------------------
``` bash
grunt build
```
This will create a *build* folder containing the built package.
Add a *data* folder with the XML files you need and open the index.html file to see your digital edition.
NB: in this case, in order to make EVT work properly in a local environment, you need to use a browser that allows Cross origin requests (e.g. Firefox).
